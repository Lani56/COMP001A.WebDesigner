            <h2 id="whatisstardewvalley">What Is Stardew Valley?</h2>
            <p id="intro">Stardew Valley is farm life simulation gave developed by Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone. Players take a roll of a character who inherits their deceased grandfather's farm in the town <em>Stardew Valley.</em> It's an open ended game where players manage a farm by clearing land, growing seasonal crops, and raising animals. Players can also build skills in farming, foraging, fishing, mining, and combat. You can also build relationships with townspeople and have the option to marry and have children(maximum is 2). The main objective of the game is to restore the farm and assist in the town's revival by completing bundles of goods to help restore the Community Center. The game progresses through its four 28-day seasons. By completing the bundles it will unlock new areas and activities, such as exploring a new island. Players my also select different farm types with each theme helping the player on improving different types of skills faster. The farming system allows players to plant seasonal seeds that need daily watering and must usually be harvested before the next season. Players can also build barns and coops to raise animals for products like eggs and milk. By giving gifts to the townspeople it builds relationships over time. Each morning the player begins with a full energy bar which decreases as tasks are completed and can be replenished by eating food. A nearby cave system holds ores that can be mined and smelted(using a furnace). The caves also house monters giving the mining experience an action RPG feel. Having a sword and pickaxe is necessary while exploring deeper levels, where more valuable treasures can be found. You can also play co-op but having the same device is necessary such as pc players can only play with other pc players.</p>

            <h2 id="communitycenter">Community Center</h2>
            <p>The Community Center is located above Pierre's shop on the way to Robin's shop. It consists of multiple bundles to be completed. You unlock the community center by getting a cutsence of Lewis the mayor on day 5 in the Spring (make sure it'd between 8:00m-1:00pm and it's not raining) talking to you about the center. You enter it then see a green thing known as Junimo's,the cutsence ends. You enter the Community Center and then go left to a bottom room and interact with a glowing scroll/paper. You won't be able to understand it but the next day you will receive mail from the Wizard asking to come by. You will then get a cutsence after going to his tower and after that you will be able to understand the scroll/paper and be able to start completing the bundles. The bundles do you have time/seasons frames to get certain things you can see that in the <a href="table.html">tables</a> section.</p>

            <h2 id="canyoudownloadmods?here'show!">Can You Download Mods? Here's How!</h2>
            <p>Yes, you can download mods but you have to be on pc or laptop. It can be windows, mac, or Linux. This is a written tutorial for Windows the other two will be linked. You can find SMAPI on CurseForge, NexusMods, and SMPAI's website. On Windows, after you download it unzip the folder on your desktop or just in your files. Then click install Windows. A screen will pop up that will say 'Where do you want add or remove SMAPI', option 1 is your standard directory and option 2 is a custom path. Typically most people who use Steam chooses option 1. Another set of questions will pop up asking 1.Install or 2.Uninstall if it's your first time installing SMAPI type 1. Then you can copy the link that pops up; open steam and right click on Stardew Valley, click properties and then paste it to launch options. If you want to add it onto your desktop you can go to your settings again on Stardew Valley, hover over manage and then click browse local files. Once it pops up scroll down an find StardewValleyModdingAPI, right-click it, go down to new then click shortcut.</p>
            <p>Some mods that most players add are content patcher, Lookup Anything, and UI Info Suite 2. These are all more practical mods that make gameplay easy(minus content patcher). UI Info Suite 2 provides helpful information about things such as birthdays, if you upgrade or have Robin build something it says how much days you have left, displays an icon for current days luck, an icon for Queen of Sauce, icons over animals that need petting, ranges for sprinklers, scarecrows, beehives, shows NPC locations on maps(after talking to all in a new gameplay), when hovering over an item its show info for bundles or to donate to the museum, theres more but it is linked under LINKS. Content Patcher is most of the time needed for most mods it just helps load content packs that change the games data, images, and maps without replacing the XNB files.</p>

            <h2 id="tips">Tips</h2>
            <p>Here are some tips! <strong>for fishing</strong> focus on one area to fish at so mountain lake, forest lake, town river, or the beach. Once you level and are able to get a new rod along with bait or tackle you can branch of to other locations. The best rod is Iridium because you can use tackle and bait on that rod. Bait helps fish bite faster and theres different types of tackle that can help with certain things. If you plan on catching a lot of fish keep your inventory clear leaving your fishing rod and food for energy. Also, certain foods such as Trout soup that you can buy and Willy's shop can increase the green bar for a duration of time. <strong>For mining</strong> I typically go on days where the luck is either 'they day is in your hands' or on a luckier day. I tend to find stairs faster than on days where your luck is bad. Make sure to invest in weapons because some do more damage than others. Upgrade your pickaxe because the better the upgrade the faster it breaks rocks and uses less energy. You will need 5 bars of the next upgrade such as 5 copper bars for a copper pickaxe costing 2,000g. Choose the right professions, at level 5 players can choose between miner or geologist and it's up to you on what you want. At level 10 you will get two more professions and it's up to you on want seems best for you. Bring high energy/health food and utilize buffs. Certain foods can up your skill or defense which is helpful when fighting monsters. Consider rings as there are many rings that have different specialties. Also, make bombs as they help clear rocks faster and if a monster is near they take damage but be careful not to be close to a bomb as you can take damage as well. <strong>For farming</strong> Purchase whatever seeds you want and pair it with fertilizers such as basic fertilizer or quality fertilizer for increased chances of a higher quality crop. You can also buy crops that are worth more in bulk when selling to make more money. Remember certain crops grow in certain seasons and there are certain crops that continue to produce such as green beans and hops. Water crops so they continue on growing you can refill your watering can in any nearby water source or well you can purchase at Robins.</p>
